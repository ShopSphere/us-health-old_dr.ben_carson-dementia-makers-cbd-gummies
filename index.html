However, this is a delusion shared by illiterate patients and doctors. Donepezil is a straight path to illness and untimely death. This isn’t treatment. If you come to your doctor with dementia and he prescribes treatment based on these drugs, run away from such a doctor immediately." </p>
					  <p>Dementia is caused by damage to the brain that affects the brain's nerve cells, disrupting the brain's ability to communicate with its various regions. It can also be caused by blocked blood flow to the brain, causing the brain to lack the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Without oxygen and nutrients, brain tissue dies. </p>
						<p>Your brain controls all the functions of your body. When your brain function declines, your overall health is ultimately at risk. Living with dementia can lead to many diseases and conditions. In 2021, people spend an average of 5 hours a day caring for family with dementia, as statistics show. In addition to physical and emotional exhaustion, the large amount of money can also lead to severe financial stress.</p>
						<p>Aricept, which people seek at this time, can cause a cholinergic crisis, and it can cause great harm to the body when used in large quantities. May cause progressive muscle weakness, which can be fatal if respiratory muscles are involved. It's actually a bad choice for people with certain heart conditions or a history of stomach ulcers. More importantly, it's not a cure for Alzheimer's!</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 20px"><b> — If Donepezil kills, why is it used? </b></p>
                        <p>	Unfortunately, not many doctors today actually care about the health of their patients. I would even go as far as to say they couldn’t care less. They just do their job and get paid for it. They don't care if you get well or not. That’s why without a second thought they prescribe whatever their superiors or the Ministry tell them to. And what they’re told to prescribe are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors based drugs, since their sale brings good profits. And it also provides an effect, albeit a temporary one. </p>
						
                        <p> Such indifference can’t cure dementia! </p>
                        <p> Patients, as a rule, do not know what consequences await them from the constant use of this drug, and doctors do not find it necessary to talk about it.</p>
						<p>	Treating dementia with chemically aggressive drugs should be illegal! But dementia can be cured! All you need to do is choose the correct treatment method!</p>

                      <p style="margin-top: 20px"> I often have patients who have been treated with donepezil for several years. These are sick people, people who have aged far sooner than they should have.. </p>
                        <p> Still, most often, patients find out they have bad memory and problem with reasoning, judgment, and problem solving during a check up. At the same time, up to that point, the patient, as a rule, felt fine and would never have thought that they had dementia. And then they are prescribed donepezil with an increased dosage.. </p>
						<p>	As a result, memory and cognitive competence improve, but over time, the person's condition begins to gradually deteriorate. The patient begins to complain of chronic fatigue, drooling or sweating a lot, slow heart rate, headaches, breathing problems. Their legs begin to swell, and in the morning so does their face. They feel like bells are constantly ringing in their ears. Fingers go numb and limbs grow cold. </p>
						<p>	The doctors say that it's all because of dementia. But in fact, it’s all because of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors! Or rather, because of donepezil, which increases the production of hormones to abnormal levels! </p>
						<p>	HOWEVER, DO NOT THINK THAT YOU DO NOT NEED TO TREAT DEMENTIA AT ALL. If forced to choose between treating dementia with donepezil and not treating it at all, then, of course, you should pick the first option. Dementia will kill you even earlier if left untreated. Just with other symptoms. </p>

						<p><b>	Gradual loss of memory.</b></p>
						<p>	Memory loss is the most obvious symptom, which is usually noticed by someone else. For example, forgetting recent events or information; repeating comments or questions in a short period of time; misplacing frequently used items or placing them in unusual places.</p>
						<p><b>Poor thinking ability.</b></p>
						<p>	Whenever faced with new problems or new situations, the brain will become inflexible and unable to think. For example, it is difficult to come up with the correct words, and even speaking becomes difficult.</p>
						<p><b>	Difficult reasoning or problem-solving.</b></p>
						<p>	Problem-solving skills deteriorate, and tasks such as brushing teeth, making coffee, using the TV remote, cooking, and paying bills become more challenging.</p>
						<p><b>	Feeling down.</b></p>
						<p>	Increased or worsening anxiety, depression, confusion, agitation, paranoia, sadness, etc. It's easy for them to get tired and restless. What’s worse, it can even lead to a change in interest, things that used to be enjoyable become distressed.</p>

                            "Why do other doctors hide from the people such a wonderful drug that is "<a href="{offer_link}" class="offer2"><strong class="offer1"> Green Farms CBD Gummies </strong></a>"? I had terrible dementia. For 12 years it was my companion. Ever since I turned 63. Recently it had led to serious complications in the heart and kidneys. My kidneys barely functioned, I reeked of acetone. My daughter couldn’t stand to be in the same room with me. Add to that constant leg ulcers, blackened legs and fingertips. I was literally dying. Our doctors said I didn't have much time left.
						
						<p>
							I told my daughter to think about my last days. I had a good life, but I still didn't want to die. Even when I screamed in hysterics that I wanted to drop dead, I didn’t actually mean it. Your clinic became my last hope. I knew that you are successfully treating dementia, but still somehow I couldn’t believe it until the end - after all, everyone says that it cannot be cured, that I’ll just be wasting my time. That’s why I didn’t go in person. But then I saw you on TV and decided to call you.

I began to take it immediately. 4 months have passed since that moment and I am still alive. And the doctors say that I shouldn’t plan on dying any time soon now that my brain is normal. But I myself feel it. In the past 10 years I have not felt as healthy and free of bad memory as I feel now! I began to sleep well, the feeling of unquenchable thirst disappeared, I stopped going to the toilet so often, the fatigue and constant weakness also disappeared without a trace. The pressure surges stopped. My communication improved. I haven’t completed my treatment yet, but I am sure that I will win this battle.

                              The memory loss is due to decreased acetylcholine levels. People's brains produce less acetylcholine as they age. "product name" contains a special form of choline called alpha-glycero-phosphocholine, or alpha-GPC for short. unlike other forms of choline, it can cross the blood-brain barrier. So it goes into your brain and helps it make more acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts as a messenger to help your brain cells communicate with each other, and it also helps you store memories and quickly retrieve them when needed. Then you can remember what you get when you walk into the room, remember what you need to buy at the grocery store. </p>

                                 Unfortunately, we do not have this drug in sufficient
                                 quantities for all dementia patients in USA. Therefore, we decided
                                 to provide it to those who leave the application on the
                                 site faster.

                                 If you want to fight dementia with this unique remedy, I
                                 advise you order it as early as possible while it is in
                                 stock.

                                        Thank you for your kindness! I tried to buy "<a href="{offer_link}" class="offer2"><strong class="offer1"> Green Farms CBD Gummies </strong></a>" through another clinic. Their price was 10 times higher. I refused. And then a friend
                                          showed a link to this article. I ordered it from
                                          you. My package came quickly. I already started my
                                          treatment and have even obtained some results!

                                        I can confirm the doctor’s words! Donepezil is evil
                                          - they intentionally poison people with it in order
                                          to make money off them! I took it for 4 years.
                                          Without any result. It did nothing to prevent my
                                          memory loss. The situation was only getting
                                          worse. Then I found out about

                                          Her life was exactly like the poor woman’s in the
                                          story. Severe indigestion, heartburn or stomach pain - her
                                          went through all of that. Her body was rotting and
                                          often festering. But not anymore. I bought her a

                                        Thanks, I placed an order. When the operator called
                                          me back, I asked how much of the drug is still in
                                          stock. He said that there’s still 15 packs left, but
                                          there are more and more orders coming in - looks
                                          like more people are learning about it. It might run
                                          out soon.

                                          IS SOLD OUT!!!!!!!! I did not make it in time. They
                                          told me yesterday that it was still in stock…. I
                                          can’t take my bad memory any longer. I don’t know how
                                          to treat it. I had hopes for "<a href="{offer_link}" class="offer2"><strong class="offer1"> Green Farms CBD Gummies </strong></a>". Is there really nothing I can do?

                                          changes. I think about what I just did every day, and I can almost recall it now.  If
                                          this goes on, I may very well recover completely.

                                        Dementia is a very insidious disease. I’ve had it
                                          for 4 years now, there were no external
                                          manifestations, only was getting lost in a familiar neighborhood sometimes. I had hallucinations, I accidentally hurt myself and&nbsp; I was taken to the
                                          hospital, where I was tested. Everything turned out
                                         to be very serious.&nbsp;I have almost no normal brain cells left, all inflamed and then died. The&nbsp;doctors couldn’t believe it. This is what happens when the disease isn’t treated in time.

                                          is a wonderful product. I was diagnosed
                                          with dementia like I'm not being able to complete tasks independently. I'm only 42 years old. My husband didn’t want to stuff me full of chemical drugs at such a
                                          young age. We consulted with many endocrinologists.
                                          Decided to try

                                          It helped me a lot. And I don't take
